            I love to watch car racing as Car Racing is not just about 20+ car's running round the track several times, it's the Andrenaline Rush that all of us feel watching a race getting unfold, The mechanical marvel that we have achieved, The limits that we have crossed (several times) It's not easy for a piece of metal to reach 300kmph/190mph it's us who made it possible.
            <br>
            <br>
            Car Racing is just not all Cars and no Human, It's also about the Ability to Pilot that car way above limits of ourselfs & that cars' which is made possible by our own.
            <br>
            <br>
            Driving a car is not just about understanding the mechanical aspects of driving a car, it's about controlling something on your own in various critical conditions, it's also about enjoying yourself handle that piece of metal unfolding it's marvel which indeed what it was made for.
            <br>
            <br>
            Reaching 250kmph is really a thrilling experience & some people do it to support there livelyhood.
            <br>
            It's really mind blowing. How we, as a human are able to reach such milestones.
